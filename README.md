#
This script serves as an introductory exercise to Python programming, covering the essential building blocks of the language. It demonstrates how to store, manipulate, and organize data using standard programming conventions.

# Variable Initialization: Storing different types of data (integers, floats, strings, and booleans) in named memory locations.
 - Data Types:
    - int: Whole numbers (e.g., year of birth).
    - float: Decimal values (e.g., weight).
    - str: Textual data (e.g., names).
    - bool: Logic states (True or False).
# Basic Arithmetic & Logic: Using operators to calculate age, convert units (Lbs to Kgs), and perform numerical comparisons.
 - Data Structures:
    - Lists: Storing multiple items in a single, ordered sequence.
    - Dictionaries: Mapping specific "keys" to "values" for structured data retrieval.
 - Output Formatting: Using print() statements to display processed data and concatenate strings into readable sentences.
